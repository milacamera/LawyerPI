  1.  INTRODUCTION

Knowing the difficulties faced because of the current pandemic, the group developed the project of an online platform of emergency
legal advice for people who have incurred debts due to for people who have incurred debts due to the economic crisis (LockDown and horizontal isolation) 
caused by the Covid-19 pandemic (coronavirus).
It consists of a registry for the primary user as an Individual or Legal Entity, a registry for the secondary user as consulting attorney and a database with the 
information of the associated banks of the company/person.
Our platform is geared to law firms interested in offering this type of service to their clients, and is available for installation on 
mobile application stores and web access.


  2.  ABOUT THE PROJECT
  
The project arose from a brainstorm proposed by professor Andressa as a proposal for solutions to the pandemic moment.
After group discussions, we came up with the idea of creating a legal support service for people who in this moment of social isolation lost their
source of income and ended up becoming delinquent, and accumulating debts.
The legal support is for both individuals and legal entities, MEI, Individual Microentrepreneur, Microenterprises.
From an online platform or application, the client registers in the system, entering his personal data, credit history, and pending financial issues.
In another interface of the platform, lawyers who would like to provide legal advice register and enter their professional data.
The system cross-references the data and indicates the registered lawyers in the region where the client lives, giving options to choose the closest lawyer.
From this moment on, the lawyer accesses the data provided by the client and analyzes it, creating an analysis history in the system itself.
After this process, he contacts the client, explaining the possible solutions and whether the client is interested in filing a lawsuit or using the professional's accessory.
The main idea is to make it easier for legal professionals to connect with potential clients, making this service easier and cheaper.
